When proposing policy in Congress, Senators from some states might favor proposing bills of certain policy areas more than others because of the aforementioned differences in regions.

The data included many fields, however, the ones we stored were bill number, congress number, sponsor, state, and policy area. The most important data categories we stored were the policy area and state, because we could use them to create plots comparing state and policy areas, helping us find trends within regions. \n",

Once this dataframe was made, it was converted to a csv file using the same formatting for rows and columns as described for the dataframe. Putting this data onto geospatial plots demonstrating the most popular policy area, by color, for each state allows us to visually see trends through groups of states marked with the same color.\n",

This is likely caused by the fact that the larger populations have more opinions, requests, and influence on their Senators, causing them to propose more bills representing their citizens.

                "This geoplot shows each state’s most proposed policy area of legislation on a color scale. Multiple states of the same color show preference toward a specific policy area. An initial look at this map reveals no large or noticeable groups of colors. However, there are smaller groupings. Midwestern states like Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri all share a common policy area, “Government Operations and Politics,” which was predicted above knowing that Michigan and Ohio were most active in proposing bills. This however, does not align with our initial thinking that Midwestern states would favor bills relating to agriculture. Other small groups of states with similar policies are Montana and North Dakota for “Armed Forces and National Security,” Colorado and Utah for “Science, Technology, Communications,” Kentucky and Illinois for “Health,” Georgia, Tennessee, Iowa and Texas for “Crime and Law Enforcement,” New York and Connecticut for “Agriculture and Food,” Washington, Nevada and Wyoming for “Health,” South Dakota and Kansas for “Finance and Financial Sector.” Some of these results are surprising. For example, New York and Connecticut share a common policy area of “Agriculture and Food,” although neither states are usually thought of as being associated with agriculture. This suggests the importance of not being presumptuous about state issues, interests, and industries. It also demonstrates that Senators may not be proposing legislation based on national interests rather than their states interest. That being said, no conclusive answer as to why this happened can be answered using our data, this is purely speculation. \n",
                "\n",
                "There likely are reasons why agriculture and food bills are most popular for New York and Connecticut, they may just be poorly known in the public sphere. Trends with other states, though, do align with what is heard in the public sphere. For example, Armed Forces and National Security bills are most common for Montana and North Dakota. This could be related to the fact that both Montana and North Dakota have many military bases located within their state. But this also does not tell the full story: by looking at the geoplot of the amount of bills from each state, Montana and North Dakota both proposed a small amount of bills, less than five, meaning that it is possible that there were no repeat policy areas, so the alphabetical first of the policy areas was chosen. This trend could be apparent for multiple of the state combinations with the same common policy area.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Conclusion\n",
                "Overall, the groupings of states with common policy areas are not very clear as there are not clear regional boundaries between most common policy areas. While there are some adjacent states with similar policy areas, it is generally not a whole region as we hypothesized. In conclusion, there likely is not a strong correlation between geographic region and the most common policy area of a state. Therefore, Senators from different geographic regions likely do not prioritize certain bill policy areas over others. \n"
